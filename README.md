**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**

To ensure my code, program, or software is secure, I run unit tests and ensure taht I am following the requirements. From there, I make the necessary adjustments as needed and make sure that I am documenting my code appropriately and correctly.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**

The main way that I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program is by following the requirments of the program. This ensures that all bases are covered when it comes to development, and also makes sure we are developing a product that satisfies those who we are developing for. Another way to incorporate needs of the user into the program is by accounting for user stories.

**How do I approach designing software?**

The way that I approach designing software is by taking into account all of the use cases for the program or software. I also try to keep in mind who we are developing for, and why we are developing the product. I also take into acocunt the requirements of the program/software. Those requirments should cover all functionality traits of the product and by following them, we can release a quality product.
